The Arts & Crafts movement was born post [[The Age of Machinery and Thomas Carlyle's criticism|The Machine Age]], due to the disenchantment craftsmen had because of the industrialization. This movement is admired for the utility it brought to design and for the way artists and artisans worked together in order to achieve beautiful, useful objects that were accesible to everyone.
