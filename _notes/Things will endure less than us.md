[[Antonio Sant'Elia's search for new frontiers|Antonio Sant'Elia]], the most well-known [[The Futurist Manifesto and Filippo Marinetti|futurist]] architect, wrote in his manifesto that the materials that futurists should use for their buildings were light (reinforced concrete, steel, glass) and elastic, in order to create impermanent and transcient designs. He believed in the use of dynamic, strong lines, oblique and elliptic, instead of the perpendicular and straight lines of the Classicism. He wanted to create a new 'ugly' aesthetic of the machine, making his buildings dramatic expressions of the new age. An idea that he mentioned was the ephemerality of everything, saying that 'every generation must build its own city', since cities would grow out of fashion with every new generation that lived in them.
