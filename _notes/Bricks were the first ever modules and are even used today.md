Bricks were the first standardized constructive materials, having standard dimensions or proportions that helped build [[Masonry walls, structural or non-structural|brick structural walls]]. Their usual dimensions are 240x115x63, which is Lxlxh, these dimension making it possible to interweave the bricks so they have discontinuous vertical joints. The standard brick module is that L=2l+joint, the joint having a thickness of 10 mm.
