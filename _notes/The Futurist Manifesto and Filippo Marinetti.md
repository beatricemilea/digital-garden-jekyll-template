Futurism was an artistic and architectural movement that wanted to bring a radical change and break with tradition. Through 'The Futurist Manifesto', the one who initiated this movement, Filippo Marinetti, wanted to proclaim the new ideals that he thought revolutionary. Some of these ideals were the urgency for change, embracing technological progress and [[The Age of Machinery and Thomas Carlyle's criticism|the industrialization]], going into the unknown and the danger that comes with it, speed and the automobile, energy, courage, revolution and war, and all these tumultuous feelings that he though were willing to make people change.
