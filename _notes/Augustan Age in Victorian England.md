The Augustan Age means the period of highest artistic refinement in the evolution of a certain style or movement. In this case, the Victorian style, or the English classicism, that emerged in late 18th and 19th century after the Civil War. Some key features of the Augustan period in England are the normalization of the artistic expression, meaning elegance and prestige, but also dullness and the lack of adventure and ambiguity.
