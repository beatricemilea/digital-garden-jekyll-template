Felix Candela was a Spanish achitect who dedicated his career to the development of thin [[Reinforced concrete, the artificial stone|reinforced concrete]] shells, popularly known as 'cascarones'. He proved that reinforced concrete can be a very suitable form for domes and shell lines, as those curvilinear shapes eliminate the tensile forces in the concrete.
