The Japanese art and architecture and its motifs were frequent sources of inspiration for the early 20th century movements, since they brought an oriental touch of novelty and an exotic twist to architecture from the west. Exaggerated vertical and flattened forms or figures, spatial depth, a certain ambiental lighting and atmospehere, Japanese prints and the emphasis on man-made rather than machine-made were only some sources of inspiration for western artists and architects.
