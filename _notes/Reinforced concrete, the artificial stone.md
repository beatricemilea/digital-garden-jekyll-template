Reinforced concrete is a composite building material that combines concrete or cement with steel reinforcement in order to create rigid architectural elements (walls, beams, slabs). It is also called 'artificial stone' because of its physical properties resembling the stone's, being regarded as a fluid stone, since concrete has to be poured into a cast in order for it to dry in a certain shape. This fluidity also refers to the great variety of forms that can be created using reinforced concrete, as it can be poured in any formwork of any shape.
