[[Arts & Crafts, where the artist and the artisan work together|William Morris]] once said 'Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful', a quote highlighting perfectly the paradigms on which minimalism nowadays is built. The excess ought to be always removed, and only those artifacts that are considered to be of useful or aesthetic value should be kept, because only those can enhance the spatial value of a home.
