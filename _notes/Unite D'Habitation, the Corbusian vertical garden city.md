After the Second World War, Le Corbusier was comissioned to solve the housing issue for the people of Marseille, a city that has been bombed during the war. He designed Unite D'Habitation in order to create a big density of people still living comfortably and according to the [[The Machine as a house to live in|minimal standards of living]]. He focused on creating a [[Community and the traits that define its lifestyle|community]] of people shopping, living, playing together, all having access to the park (in the [[The Park-City, La Ville Radieuse|park-city]]) in which the building was built. This residential complex resembled 120 overlaid on top of one another, each with their own private garden, thus creating a beautiful [[Habitation as a way of being in the world|habitat of living]] for all of the inhabitants.
