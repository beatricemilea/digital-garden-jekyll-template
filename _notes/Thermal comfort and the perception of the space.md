Thermal and thermo-physiological comfort is the science studying the thermal phenomena perceived by human beings. It is strongly related to the [[Sensual perception in architecture|sensual perception]] of a space and of its properties. The man's temperature is the pondered average between the temperature of the man's skin (that is around 36.5 °C) and the temeperature of the clothes he is wearing, therefore Tman=24 °C, or 28°C. This means that there is a constant exchange of heat between the man and the environment, either through the **dry** means, [[Conduction, convection and radiation|conduction,convection and radiation]], either through **humid** (evaporation) means, such as sweat and breath vapors. All these factors ensure the thermal comfort via the unconscious thermoregulation of the body, without it being overwhelming for the body.
