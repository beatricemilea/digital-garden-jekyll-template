The 19th century is well known as [[The Age of Machinery and Thomas Carlyle's criticism|The Machine Age]], the age in which the industrialization took place. That also brought the invention of the railway, meaning that the city had to make room for the emerging railways. That was not ideal at the beginning at least, since the railways went literally through buildings and the outcome of it was invading the privacy of courtyards and apartments, revealing the image of the posterior part of the residences, the part that was definitely not supposed to be seen by the public eye of the street. Apart from the many accidents that occured because of this less-than-ideal set-up of the railway stations, it also caused a lot of terror within the residents of the city. This portrayed the [[Modernity. Modernisation. Modernism.|new, emerging dynamic modernity]] of the city.
