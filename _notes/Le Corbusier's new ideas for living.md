Le Corbusier started out his architectural journey by aiming towards providing [[Affordable housing vs privileged housing|affordable housing]] for non-elite beneficiaries, thus solving the [[Dwelling as a complex issue and its relation to the city|housing issue]] prevalent in the interbelic period. After various explorations, he created collective houses with closed parcels, having five double levels and 'hanging' gardens. These houses were build over big parks, and had to interior courtyards. These 'immeuble-villas', as he used to call them, were thought of being a residential complex with common amenities. This was a search of his that started out from the Maison Citrohan. These apartment block were sometimes regarded as the new [[Paris and the Haussmanian regulations|rapport buildings]].
