Houses can be regarded as alive organisms that carry on a certain life. They evolve and always change,together with the changing of the times or with the weather. There even is a discipline called 'The Pathology of Houses', that investigates the way they behave in time and what 'illnesses' they are most likely to develop. That is why, when a house has a horizontal or a vertical crack, it's not dangerous, it may only suggest a different kind of materiality and the way the elements [[Mortar, the binder paste for masonry|bind]] together. If a crack is diagonal, however, that may indicate a more serious issue.
