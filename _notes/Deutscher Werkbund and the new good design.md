Deutscher Werkbund was the German Association for arts and crafts that consisted of artists, artisans and architects that wished to create good design combining craftsmenship and mass-produced goods. It was inspired from the English [[Arts & Crafts, where the artist and the artisan work together|Arts & Crafts movement]], and its intellectual leaders were Hermann Muthesius and Henry Van De Velde. The two leaders split their ideals, meaning that Van De Velde explored the individual side of expression, while Muthesius was the advocate of mechancical mass-production and standardized design. The Deutscher Werkbund eventually continued its path with the ideals of Muthesius. They believed in standardization in architecture, therefore they created the design norms and standards we know even in our days.
