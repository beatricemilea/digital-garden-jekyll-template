Collective fortifications in [[The Transylvanian territory and the minorities of the 10th century|Medieval Transylvania]] were the fortifications that consisted of urban large and long sites. One example of such is the one in Sebes, that was kept as a privilege from the Magyar king. It had a belt made of walls (with a watchguard way behind) and ramparts that were used to support the fireguns. The city had scarce material resources and it was attacked by the ottomans before it was even finished. Another example of a collective fortification is the city of Sibiu, which had very well-developed and extended fortifications, therefore the whole settlement was well-defended. Another example of collective fortifications were the rural ones, located close to villages and kept by peasants. They had an interior defense mechanism and a fortified church, and the houses consisted of a continuous street front and other appendix at the back.
