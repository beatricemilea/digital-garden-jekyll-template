Hendrik Petrus Berlage was a Dutch architect of the early 20th century, who believed in the creation of [[Raumplan and the fluidity of the space|spaces]] rather than of bidimensional representations. He believed that ornaments and decoration are not necessary, since they are bound to get out of fashion, whereas a geometric and scientific compostion can never be altered and go out of fashion. He was the one to introduce the problem of having a style again, rather than just isolated [[Modernity. Modernisation. Modernism.|modern]] movements that prefigurated Modernism.
