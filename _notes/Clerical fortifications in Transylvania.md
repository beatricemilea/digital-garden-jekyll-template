Clerical fortifications in [[The Transylvanian territory and the minorities of the 10th century|Medieval Transylvania]] were the ones founded around churches and by the clergy. Such an example is Alba-Iulia or Oradea, their main characteristic being the fact that the church was located in the city centre. Another example would be the secular monasteries of the 16th century, that became the property of the laic state. Such a monastery would be the Benedictine Monastery from Cluj.
