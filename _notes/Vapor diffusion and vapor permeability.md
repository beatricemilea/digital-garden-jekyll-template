Vapor diffusion is a physical property in the field of [[Hygrothermics in architecture|hygrothermics]] that describes the movement of the water vapors from the areas with bigger pressure towards the areas with lower pressure. The **Vapor Permeability Factor**, μd, represents the number of times one certain material is less permeable than another. The **Vapor Permeability Coefficent**, μ and the **Restistance to Vapor Permeability**, Rv is the capacity of the construction element to oppose to the humidity transfer. Rv=d(μd)M [m/s], d being the width of the element and M being a constant value.
