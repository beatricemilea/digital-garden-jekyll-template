In the composition of the regular [[Concrete blocks and their advantages|concrete blocks]], the aggregates play a big role in the way the block behaves in different situations. These aggregates can be heavy or light, the lighter ones being more porous thus more thermal-insulating. The porosity of the concrete leads to products with more diverse specific gravities. The more porous the concrete is, the smaller the mechanic resistance is, but the bigger its thermal-insulation capacities are.
