At the end of the 18th century, many thinkers of the period began to question the true necessity of the classical language, so wide-spread in all the belle arts. Marc-Antoine Laugier made a clear connection between the beauty and honesty of the logical structure of a building and the classical orders, these having evolved from the primitive hut. Laugier believed that every building ought to be composed from basic structural elements: posts, beams and a roof. This explanation was rather historical, but understanding the roots of what it meant to build a house led to new ideas further explored by thinkers of the time.
