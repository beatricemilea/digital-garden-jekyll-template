Massive [[Masonry walls, structural or non-structural|masonry walls]], as well as concrete slabs, are known to have a high thermal mass. Thermal mass is the property of a material to absorb and store thermal energy, in our case, heat from the sun. The fact that masonry has a high thermal mass represents an advantage for choosing it when designing sustainable buildings as this property of the walls and slabs enables the regulation of the interior micro-climate of the house, hence reducing the costs of the heating during the winter, respectively of cooling during the summer.
