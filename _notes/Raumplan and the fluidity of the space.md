[[Ornament is Crime|Adolf Loos]] was one of the first architects to employ the use of the Raumplan, a spatial organization principle based on the fluidity of the space. Unlike [[Unity as expressed in Frank Lloyd Wright's works|Wright]], Loos created this fluidity in section, by dematerializing the floors and creating a complex interior space. He believed that a house doesn't need a rigid separation on floors of identical heights, but rather spaces in themselves that were all different, thus they all required different heights and sizes. His interiors were formed by spaces, rooms, salons, terraces, all interconnected, making the vertical circulations not only unnoticeable, but also functional. The complexity of the interior space contrasted with the simplicity and rather monumentality of the exterior.
