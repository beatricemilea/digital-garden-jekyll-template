In the [[Augustan Age in Victorian England|Pre-Vectorian era]], as a reaction to the sorrows of the recently-ended Civil War, the Romantic mood emerged in England with poets such as William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Lord Byron. The romantic fancy of distant moods, people, places was a way to escape the brutal memories of the past traumatic experiences, thus celebrating nature and love. Romanticism focused on the contemplation and comprehension of reality in novel ways, both for sorrowful memories of the past and the new upcoming reality.
