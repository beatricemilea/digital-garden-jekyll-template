Conduction, convection and radiation are three principles of [[Hygrothermics in architecture|hygrothermics in architecture]] that describe the ways thermal energy is transmitted between objects. **Conduction** is described by the coefficent λ, meaning the ease with which heat can go through an object. λ[W/mK]. Thermal resistance (R) is the capacity of the built elements to oppose the transfer of heat. R=d/λ [m²K/W], d=element thickness. Thermal permeability (U) is the capacity of a built element to allow the transfer of heat. U=λ/d [W/m²K]. **Convection** is described by the superficial (on the surface) exchange of heat (αc,αcv). Resistance to superficial heat exchange Rc=1/αc [m²K/W]. **Radiation** is described by the radiant thermal flux.
