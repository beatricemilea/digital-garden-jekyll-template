Throughout history, there were multiple thinkers, architects, urbanists, philosophers etc. that tried to visualize different ideologies and ideas embodied in some fictional, utopian, ideal cities. What they usually had in common was their lack of real-life applicability and feasibility. However, they were interesting for the values they promoted, that illustrated very clearly how different people saw solutions to different urban problems of their times.
