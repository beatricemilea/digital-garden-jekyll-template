The glass wall towards the South idea was used in [[Frank Lloyd Wright's unique vocabulary|Frank Lloyd Wright's]] 'Solar Hemicycle' house. He oriented the house towards the sun so it could benefit from as much heating as possible, while towards the North he made a thick structural wall covered in earth. This thick wall from the back stored the heat accumulated during the day and released it during the night. This design is very sustainable, as it reduces the energy costs of the house.
