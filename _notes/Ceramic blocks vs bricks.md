Ceramic blocks are bricks that are bigger in dimension and that have different kinds of properties adapted by producers. They are used for [[Masonry and its constructive particularities|masonry]]. Their main advantage, compared to normal bricks, is the fact that because of the fact that they are larger in size and thickness, the number of joints is reduced, as well as the execution time on site.
