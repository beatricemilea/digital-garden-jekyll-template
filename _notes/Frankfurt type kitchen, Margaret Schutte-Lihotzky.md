The Frankfurt type kitchen, designed by Margaret Schutte-Lihotzky, an Austrian architect of the 20th century, was a design and architecture milestone. It embodied the idea of equipment as opposed to furniture, meaning that by the standardization of the kitchen module in 60x60 cm units, the presence of all the neccessary equipment in everyone's kitchens could have been assured. This way, all people could have benefited from [[The Machine as a house to live in|a minimum standard of living]].
