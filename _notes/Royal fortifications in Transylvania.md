The royal/voivodal fortifications in [[The Transylvanian territory and the minorities of the 10th century|Medieval Transylvania]] were either residential (centres of different territories), administrative centers of a certain territory or borderline. These fortifications were usually royal first and then given to the common use. For example, the citadel of Rupea was located on an important commercial route and it was protected by the [[Factors that contributed to the development of Transylvania|Transylvanian saxons]], making use of the natural height that also protected it from invaders. This citadel was composed by a guard way and an operational thick wall that protected the premises, while the canopy was used as the attack spot. The citadel also had turrets with ramparts (that were oriented towards the base of the citadel) and roofings oriented towards the inside of the citadel in order for them not to catch fire.
