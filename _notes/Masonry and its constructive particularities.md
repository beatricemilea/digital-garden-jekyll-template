Masonry is a building material and a constructive technique that first appeared in Ancient Rome and was used since then for many buildings. The masonry can be made either using bricks, either using stone or other newer materials, such as ceramic blocks or ACB. One property that the masonry has is the high compression resistance, allowing it to be a sturdy and great building material both for structural and non-structural walls. However, it only allows very particular constructive solutions, since it has some strict set of rules and limitations that has to be taken into consideration.
