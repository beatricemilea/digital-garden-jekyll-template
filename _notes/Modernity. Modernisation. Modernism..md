[[Modernity is the difference between past and present|Modernity]] refers to those features of the present time that are different from what there used to be in the past. It refers to a transformation, an on-going process of renewal and discovery.

Modernisation is a process in which entities become modern, they improve and become closer to the ideals of the society's development. They are related to the technological progress, [[The Age of Machinery and Thomas Carlyle's criticism|industrialization]], urbanization and the growth of the population.

Modernism is an international artistic movement born at the beginning of the 20th century. It was based on the same ideals of development and progess of the technology, and it included theoretical and practical ideas about the transformation of the world.
