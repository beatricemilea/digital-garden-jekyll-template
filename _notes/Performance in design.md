The performance in design has to be taken into consideration when designing a sustainable and efficient building. When designing such a building, one has to take into consideration the following aspects: stability and resistance (safety, exploitation aptitude and durability), fire safety, impermeability and airtightness, [[Hygrothermics in architecture|hygrothermal requirements]], atmospheric ambiance, acoustic requirements, visual requirements, hygiene requirements, adapting to the space's utility, durability and economy. All of these lead to structural engineering's preoccupation for stability, resistance, durability and rigidity, some attributes that each building ought to have.
