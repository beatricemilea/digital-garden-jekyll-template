The [[Hygrothermics in architecture|thermal transfer]] through opaque elements is defined by the **Specific thermal resistance** (for a homogenous layer of the built element) which is Rs=d/λ [m²K/W], while **Thermal resistance** is R=Rsi + ∑ (n->j=1) dj/λj+Rse [m²K/W], where dj is the width of the layer j [m]. Rsi and Rse are the resistances of the superficial heat exchange [m²K/W], while λj is the thermal [[Conduction, convection and radiation|conductivity]] of the layer j [W/mK].
