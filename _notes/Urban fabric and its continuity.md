Urban fabric or tissue is called this way due to its complex properties that resemble the properties of a tissue found in Biology or of a piece of textile. It has a continuity due to common, easily-recognizable elements that form repetable patterns. Three elements that can be found in all urban tissues are: the street network, the plots and the buildings.
