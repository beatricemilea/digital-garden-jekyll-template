GFRC is a composite material that is similar to chopped fiberglass, being though much weaker. Itâ€™s made by combining a mixture of fine sand, cement, polymer, water, other mixtures and glass fibers. GFRC are used to construct lightweight panels, because the GFRC panels are much thinner than traditional concrete panels. They are high compressive, flexural and have good tensile strength.
