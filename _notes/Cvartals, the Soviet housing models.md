Cvartals were a [[Socialism and the emphasis on the collective|socialist model]] of urban units of dwellings organized around community spaces, with low-rise buildings and a very strong presence of community facilities (schools, kindergartens, cinemas). The idea of the cvartal started out following the [[Red Vienna and the Viennese Hofs|Viennese Hofs]] example, as well as [[Fourier's Phalanstery as a social palace|Fourier's ideal of social palace]]. This soviet cvartal embodies the stalinist organism, consisting of urban units aligned to the street, enclosing one or more courtyards, made of collective housing with an architecture with a classical and monumental character. Compared to the Vienesse Hofs, however, they were far less experimental.
