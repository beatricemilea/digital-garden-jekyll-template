One way in which a space could be enriched by the architecture is by creating an angular design, with angled walls, a break from the traditional rectangular boxes that we are all used to. These angles will enable the people walking through the space to relate to the interesting spaces created by them in interesting ways, these angles making them move according to the inclination of that angle. The large spaces contrast with the sharp edges these angled walls create, allowing people to feel exposed, respectively protected in these  particular kinds of spaces.
