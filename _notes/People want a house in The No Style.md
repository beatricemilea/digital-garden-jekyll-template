The English Free Architecture Movement was a professional crisis architects had in the 19th century, crisis emerged from the lack of accesible housing styles they could use for their residential commands. Architects were so involved in stylistic debates back then, that they forgot the basic housing needs the population had. Therefore, architects such as Charles Voysey and William Lethaby wanted to bring a change to that and designed houses that were simple and traditional.
