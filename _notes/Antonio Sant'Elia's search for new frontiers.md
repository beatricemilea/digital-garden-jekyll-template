Antonio Sant'Elia is the most renown [[The Futurist Manifesto and Filippo Marinetti|futurist]] architect, designing after the principles of Filippo Marinetti's manifesto. He believed in an urgent and necessary break with tradition and he wanted to search for new frontiers by creating a completely new aesthetic for houses and cities. He designed an [[Utopian visions of towns|ideal futurist city]] called La Citta Nuova and drew the outlook of its houses, all made of reinforced concrete, steel and glass. The progress of technology was very much embraced by this architect, as he wanted a fresh start from the beginning to the end of his works.
