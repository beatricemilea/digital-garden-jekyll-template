The Magyar population migrated in the Eastern Europe and found its place in the Pannonian Basin, close to the boundaries with Romania today. They further migrated in a territory called Transylvania (its name deriving from the *trans silvae*, meaning "over the forests"), and set the foundations of prestatal forms of dwelling and organization. These pre-states followed the oriental organization model, were surrounded by forests and had a small population, thus were vulnerable to invaders. Therefore, some population was moved towards the borders in order to protect them and maintain their safety, these people obtaining benefits in return. This population was made up of the Transylvanian Saxons (sasi), their benefits consisting of being able to organize their religious hierarchy, as well as having their own judgement rights etc.
