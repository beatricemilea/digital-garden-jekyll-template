Trulli are stone buildings found in the region of Puglia in Italy, and are innovative because of the way their constructive technique influences the micro-climate of the house on the inside. The base of a Trullo is made from a very thick stone [[Massive masonry has a high thermal mass|masonry wall]], while the conical roof is made of thinner flat rows of stone. This way, the walls absorb the heat during the day and the hot air is immediately ventilated towards the ceiling, being evacuated through the chimney. This is a way of natural ventilation and represents an example for sustainable ways of building for contemporary architecture.
