Within a city, every new building and parceling has to be subdued to a set of pre-existent regulations. Such regulations are of three types: General Urbanistic Plan (PUG) (regulating a big area or a whole city), Zonal Urbanistic Plan (PUZ) (regulating just a specific area within a city) and Detail Urbanistic Plan (PUD) (regulating just a single parcel or parceling). The general plan is regulated by the town hall and in collaboration with the authorities, whereas the zonal plan can either be proposed by public or private urbanists, of course subordinating to the general plan and to the already existing set of rules.
