The Grand Tour was an extended trip around Europe that young architects in the 19th century used to go on in order to explore the various architectural edifices they were studying about in school, thus learning about architecture directly from the source. The most frequent visits were to Greece and Italy, the places where most ruins of classical architecture could be found.
