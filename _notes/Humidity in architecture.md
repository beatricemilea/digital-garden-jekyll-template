Humidity is translated to the quantity of vapors in the air. It can be of three distinct types: SATURATION, ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE. This humidity can be described by calculating the Partial Pressure of the Vapors (Pv) [Pa][mmHg], or by calculating the weight of the water vapors. **The Saturation Humidity** described by the Saturation Pressure (ps) contributes to the formation of fog, and depends on the temperature (the quantity of gas vapors) and can take place until it reaches a limit pressure. **The Relative Humidity** is noted φ=pv/ps x 100. **The Dew Point**, θr, represents the temperature for which the value of the Partial Pressure of the Vapors equals the The Saturation Pressure (pv=ps).
