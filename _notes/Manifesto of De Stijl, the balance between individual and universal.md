The De Stijl movement was born around the 'De Stijl' magazine founded by Theo van Doesburg. The movement had its own manifesto, questioning the balance between old and new, respectively individual and universal, as well as the unity of Life, Art and Culture. It was also based on the [[The Futurist Manifesto and Filippo Marinetti|annihilation of tradition]], and it proposed a completely new position for artists and architects that had to be driven by the same consciousness.
