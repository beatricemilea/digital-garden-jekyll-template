Camillo Sitte was an Austrian architect, painter and urban planner whose ideas revolutionized the urbanism of the late 19th century and further. He was part of the [[The culturalist ideological model|culturalist]] ideological model, therefore he was focused a lot on understanding the old cities of the past and see them as something to look up to. He wanted to study the old cities in order to understand what made them work and what artistic principles were used in their design, and use his discoveries in order to design the new cities. He wanted to have a conscious process of adapting old cities to something brand new and suitable for the needs of modern people, without changing the organicity and irregularity from the model illustrated by medieval cities. He wanted to create a continuity of the closed urban space, criticizing the isolated monument.
