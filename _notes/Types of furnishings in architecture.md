Furnishings in architecture can be of three distinct types: **wet and thick**, which are the traditional plaster (around 20 mm) and traditional mortar panels (around 60 mm); **wet and thin**, such as the contemporary thin plaster (around 5 mm) and the contemporary adhesive panels; and **dry**, which are represented by plywood, boards and panels that are mounted without mortar on a metal frame or directly on the supporting element (wall). The plaster usually dries at the speed of 1 mm/day and it is highly reccomended that it is kept away from direct sunlight in order to prevent the superficial drying of the plaster. The layers of the furnishings differ from case to case, but are usually the **primer** (grund), which is the thicker layer that is sometimes scratched in order to become more adherent; and the **plaster coating** (tinci), a finer layer of around 5 mm thick. Some additional layers for the plaster are the **smir** (a milky textured plaster solution usually applied on air-based plaster infills within a metallic net (rabit) ) and the **sprit** (a solution applied through the under-pressure drizzle on a wall in order to turn the surface into a more adherent surface). Some support layers can be the **rectification** layer (applied locally) and **putty** (a very fine layer made from either plaster or limestone).
