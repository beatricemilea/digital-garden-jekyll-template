Tony Garnier's proposal for The Cite Industrielle in 1917 embodied best the [[Socialism and the emphasis on the collective|socialist]] principles. It was a [[Utopian visions of towns|utopian vision]] of an isolated self-sustaining place in which zones were divided according to their functions (residential, industrial, agricultural, public; being the first such experiment that was later on adapted by Le Corbusier) and the most important buildings in the public zone were located higher on a hill, almost like in the Acropolis. The city lacked jails and hospitals, since Garnier did not believe them necessary in such a potentially well-functioning socialist city.
