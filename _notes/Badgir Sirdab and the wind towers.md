In Middle Asia, summers are very hot and dry. Therefore, cities and buildings had to adapt to this climate and this way narrow streets towards which introverted houses are lined were created, protecting the pedestrians from the sun. These houses are not open towards the streets, but to interior courtyards. A way of adapting the natural ventilation of the house was through the Bagdir Sirdab system, which is a wind tower that collects the wind, filters the dust and insects from it, takes the air through the basement in order to cool it, and distributes it into the interior courtyard that eventually ventilates all the rooms of the house.
