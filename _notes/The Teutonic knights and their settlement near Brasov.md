The Teutonic knights were a religious order and a population of people that had the role to protect the Brasov and the Prahova Valley from invaders. They had multiple privileges, being in the border area with the Magyar kingdom. They developed a strong fortificated settlement in 1211, only for it to be taken away from them in 1225 by the Magyar kingdom, as it was believed to have been representing a threat for them. However, later on, the Magyars reinforced the fortifications around that area.
