Albert Kahn was an American architect known for his major contributions to the development of the factory architectural project by using [[Reinforced concrete, the artificial stone|reinforced concrete]]. As well as that, he popularized the use of steel-frame in the construction of factories, creating the 'daylight factory'. This was a generic term for factories that had large windows and a great transparency, making mass-produced factories around the America of the beginning of the 20th century.
