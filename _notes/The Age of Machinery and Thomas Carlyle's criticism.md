The Age of Machinery refers to a period in the late 18th- early 19th century in which The Industrial Revolution, a movement that made the shift from hand-made and unique to mass-produced and standardised, led to a decline in the status of the artisan. Thus Thomas Carlyle believed that this age had a negative impact on the production activity, since then nothing had the authenticity of a hand-made product, but rather the austerity of an inanimate machine. He claimed that not only did this movement affect the external and physical aspects of production, but also the spiritual one.
