Habitation is a concept that architects have dealt with since the beginning of their profession. It is a way of being in the world, of creating relationships with things and it has to do with the process of taking care of one's surroundings. The space one is inhabiting can be non-homogenous and nuanced by the building itself through the places and experiential spaces it creates. Habitation gives birth to familiarity, closeness and identification with the inhabited environment, making humans become attached to it.
