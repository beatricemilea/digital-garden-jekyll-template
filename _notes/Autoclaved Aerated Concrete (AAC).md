Autoclaved Aerated Concrete is a type of [[Heavy or light aggregates|light aggregate]] [[Concrete blocks and their advantages|concrete blocks]] that is made out of a paste which contains an expanding adherent agent. This creates a high porosity within the material and makes the concrete become lighter and easy to be cut with the saw. The advantages of AAC lie in it being a highly thermal-insulating material as well as an energy economic one, being also called the structural thermal-insulation.
