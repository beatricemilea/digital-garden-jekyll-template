The mortar is a mix of binder (such as cement or plaster) with aggregates (sand, brick powder or stone powder) and water. This mix is used in order to stick [[Masonry walls, structural or non-structural|bricks]] to one another and create a [[Masonry walls, structural or non-structural|structural or non-structural]] wall. Mortar is used in order for the connected elements to work together, not as disparate pieces.
