# Hi there!ðŸŒ·

My name is Bea and I 've always loved architecture, but recently I've discovered there's so much more to it than what we do at university. That is the reason why I created my digital garden, a public open space for everyone who wants to join me on a beautiful journey of learning and experimenting all about architecture. Hope you find this useful! <3
