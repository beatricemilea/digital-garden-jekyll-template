# Hi there!ðŸŒ·

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Bea and I 've always loved architecture, but recently I've discovered there's so much more to it than what we do at university. That is the reason why I created my digital garden, a public open space for everyone who wants to join me on a beautiful journey of learning and experimenting all about architecture. I hope you find this useful! <3

ðŸ“š What I am currently learning about: Architectural detailing

ðŸ’­ What I am currently thinking about: House as living organisms.
